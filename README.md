# bruteforcePK1char

In case you exported your private key from Metamask with one mistake.

The script bruteforce a 1 wrong character private key and check the balance of BNB to get rid of false positive.

Upgrade to come :
* Support to other wallets
* Modification others n wrong characters (if all the charactere are wrong, I suggest you consider your funds lost forever...)
